# **Users manager application**
## _This is an application that manages a JSON data base of users._

---

## Options possible: 

- Show/Hide the form to add a new User
- Add a new User
- Filter the Users based on their gender
- Search for a user by either the first name or the last name 
- Delete a user 

---
## Data
The data in the application is not stored anywhere nor retrieved from any base. The data shown at the first reload of the application is simply a mocked data saved in the application as JSON file. 

This [`website`](https://www.mockaroo.com/) is used to mock the data.

## PS
This code works 100%, but it's still under development. `I welcome any refactoring or suggestions :smile:`
